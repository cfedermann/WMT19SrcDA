# WMT19SrcDA

Code and issue tracker for WMT19 source-based DA campaigns

## TL;DR

- WMT19 will feature source-based direct assessment (DA)
- Evaluation will be based on document-level annotation
- Source-based DA will focus on non-English target languages
- Please use the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/cfedermann/WMT19SrcDA/issues) to report any problems

## Timeline

- 5/09: eval plan online on Github
- 5/15--~5/16~ 5/20: research teams request accounts
- 5/20: accounts shared with research teams
- ~5/17~ 5/21: annotation starts
- ~5/27~ 6/03: annotation ends

## Campaign overview

### How will the annotation work?

Annotations will be collected in Appraise, implementing document-level,
source-based direct assessment. For every language pair, there will be a
pre-generated amount of annotations tasks (``HITs''). We also generate
anonymised accounts which are pre-assigned to exactly two annotation tasks.
Based on previous WMT evaluation campaigns, the average annotation time for
two tasks is one hour. So, every annotation account maps to one hour of work.

### How much annotation work is needed?

Based on previous WMT evaluation campaigns, the average annotation time for
one task is 30 minutes. One task involves approximately 100 judgements.

Each research team is expected to contribute **eight hours of annotation work
per primary system** submission. You can allocate those work hours either

- in this campaign (the instructions you are looking at right now)
- or in our reference-based evaluation campaign on Turkle, run by Matt Post and Mathias Mueller: https://github.com/bricksdont/WMT19RefDA

This translates to **16 completed tasks** in total, on Turkle or Appraise, per primary system.

### Who can be an annotator?

The source-based evaluation campaign is run for non-English target languages.
This means that we look for native speakers of the non-English target language
who are also proficient in English and can assess translation quality from
English into their native language.

### How are accounts distributed?

Account distribution is based on first-come, first-served basis, i.e., once
an account is marked as ``assigned'' to a team you cannot claim it anymore.
Each research team should designate a team leader who is then responsible to
reserve the required amount of accounts for their team.

### Where can I claim my account?

TBA

### How can I sign into Appraise?

For each account, we provide a **single sign-on (SSO) URL**. This allows you
to sign into Appraise with a single click on the URL, making access very easy.

### What information do you store about me?

There is no personal information attached to the annotation accounts. We
capture your assessments and related metadata, such as annotation start and
end time as well as duration per single assessment.

### How does source-based DA work?

TBA
